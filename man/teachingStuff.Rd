Teaching stuff in selected countries

Youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) in 43 countries from 1997 till 2015
}
\details{
Teaching staff include professional personnel directly 
involved in teaching students, including classroom 
teachers, special education teachers and other 
teachers who work with students as a whole class, 
in small groups, or in one-to-one teaching. 
Teaching staff also include department chairs 
of whose duties include some teaching, but 
it does not include non-professional personnel 
who support teachers in providing instruction 
to students, such as teachers' aides and other 
paraprofessional personnel. Academic staff include 
personnel whose primary assignment is instruction, 
research or public service, holding an academic 
rank with such titles as professor, associate 
professor, assistant professor, instructor, 
lecturer, or the equivalent of any of these 
academic ranks. The category includes personnel 
with other titles (e.g. dean, director, associate 
dean, assistant dean, chair or head of department), 
if their principal activity is instruction or research.

This indicator presents the share of young people who are 
not in employment, education or training (NEET), as 
a percentage of the total number of young people 
in the corresponding age group, by gender. 
Young people in education include those attending 
part-time or full-time education, but exclude those 
in non-formal education and in educational activities 
of very short duration. Employment is defined according 
to the OECD/ILO Guidelines and covers all those who 
have been in paid work for at least one hour in the 
reference week of the survey or were temporarily 
absent from such work. Therefore NEET youth can be 
either unemployed or inactive and not involved in 
education or training. Young people who are neither 
in employment nor in education or training are at 
risk of becoming socially excluded â€“ individuals 
with income below the poverty-line and lacking the 
skills to improve their economic situation.
