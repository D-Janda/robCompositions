Description: Methods for analysis of compositional data including robust
    methods, imputation, methods to replace rounded zeros, (robust) outlier
    detection for compositional data, (robust) principal component analysis for
    compositional data, (robust) factor analysis for compositional data, (robust)
    discriminant analysis for compositional data (Fisher rule), robust regression
    with compositional predictors and (robust) Anderson-Darling normality tests for
    compositional data as well as popular log-ratio transformations (addLR, cenLR,
    isomLR, and their inverse transformations). In addition, visualisation and
    diagnostic tools are implemented as well as high and low-level plot functions
    for the ternary diagram.
